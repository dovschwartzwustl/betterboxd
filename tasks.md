## To Do
- Implement create, edit and delete lists
    - This should only be possible on a user's own profile
- Lists should have up to 4 movie posters in them, similar to Spotify playlists
- CSS for:
    - Movie details
    - profile
    - log in
    - register
- Put movies on left and lists on right of user profile (or top or bottom but show them both in their own encapsulated sections)
- If logged in user has no movies watched it should display a search option to find movies on their profile
- Make it so that scrolling down loads more results on home page
- Update HTML/CSS for when elements are loading
- Pressing enter is the same as pressing search
- When a user logs in or registers, it takes them to their account page
- Log in to rate should return to specific page after log in
- Implement token expiring
- Add a button that searches google for show times
    - Would be even better if I could display that info directly in the app
- Set up JWT middleware and route guards for certain routes
