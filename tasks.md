## To Do
- Implement lists
- Make it so that scrolling down loads more results on home page
- When a user logs in or registers, it takes them to their account page
- Log in to rate should return to specific page after log in
- Implement token expiring
- Add a button that searches google for show times
    - Would be even better if I could display that info directly in the app
- Set up JWT middleware and route guards for certain routes
